# amwall — multilingual MSI installer build.
# Copyright (C) 2026  amwall contributors. Licensed GPL-3.0-or-later.
#
# Builds one MSI containing every language transform under wix/lang/.
# Used by both .github/workflows/release.yml (CI) and
# .vscode/tasks.json (Ctrl+Shift+B → "Build MSI installer") so the
# local build matches what tag-driven releases produce.
#
# Pipeline:
#   1. Verify WiX 3.x is on PATH (candle.exe / light.exe / torch.exe).
#   2. Compile main.wxs once with -arch x64.
#   3. Link a base MSI in en-US.
#   4. For every other wxl: link a per-culture MSI, torch -t language
#      against the base to produce a .mst, then embed the .mst into
#      the base MSI's _Storages table by LCID via the helper
#      wix/scripts/embed-transform.vbs.
#   5. Rewrite the Template summary (wix/scripts/set-languages.vbs)
#      so Windows Installer auto-applies the matching transform at
#      install time based on the user's UI language.
#
# Assumes the release binary already exists at
# target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\amwall.exe — call sites are
# expected to run cargo build first.

# Per-culture installerlocale.txt: holds the LCID of the language

# InstallerLocaleFile component. amwall reads it on every startup and
# overrides settings.language whenever the value differs from the LCID
# already recorded in settings.txt (install_lcid_seen). The base MSI
# gets en-US's LCID; each per-culture light.exe call below overwrites
# the file with that culture's LCID before linking, so torch picks up
