// Bridges the parsed `Profile` (M2) and the rules engine (M3) to

// (`-install` / `-uninstall`) and exposed publicly so embedders can
// call into the same flow.
//
// Stable provider + sublayer GUIDs let `-install` and `-uninstall`
// cooperate across process invocations: install creates persistent
// records under the well-known keys; uninstall finds them via
// `cleanup_provider(PROVIDER_KEY)` and removes everything tagged
// with that provider — filters, the sublayer, the provider itself.
//
// Windows-only because it sits on top of `wfp`.
