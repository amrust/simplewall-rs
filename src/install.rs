// (`-install` / `-uninstall`) and exposed publicly so embedders can
// call into the same flow.
//
// Stable provider + sublayer GUIDs let `-install` and `-uninstall`
// cooperate across process invocations: install creates persistent

// `cleanup_provider(PROVIDER_KEY)` and removes everything tagged
// with that provider — filters, the sublayer, the provider itself.

// Windows-only because it sits on top of `wfp`.
